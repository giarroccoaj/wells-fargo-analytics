{"name":"Wells Fargo Analytics Competition","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction.\r\n \r\n\"Dialogues on social media can provide tremendous insight into the behaviors, desires, pains, and thoughts of consumers. We'd like your help in developing a repeatable process that identifies, classifies, and extracts the underlying drivers of consumer financial conversations and comments in social media data. Use the dataset attached below.\" - (https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/wells-fargo)\r\n\r\n### The Competition.\r\n\r\nProvide analytic report of 1,500 words based on outline.\r\n\r\nQuestion #1: What financial topics* do consumers discuss on social media and what caused the consumers to post about this topic? \r\n\r\n\r\nDeliverable A - Describe your Approach and Methodology. Include a visual representation of your analytic process flow. \r\nDeliverable B - Discuss the data and its relationship to social conversation drivers. \r\nDeliverable C - Document your code and reference the analytic process flow-diagram from deliverable A. \r\n\r\nQuestion #2: Are the topics and “substance” consistent across the industry or are they isolated to individual banks? \r\n\r\nDeliverable D - Create a list of topics and substance you found \r\nDeliverable E - Create a narrative of insights supported by the quantitative results (should include graphs or charts) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
