<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Throughout my Data 101 course I was introduced to the concepts and theories behind Data Science that make it such an interdisciplinary field. Using the R programming language and popular algorithms in Big Data I was able to explore real world data and gain practical experience as a Data Scientist. </p>

<p>A recurring theme, or observation, when looking into Big Data is the idea that large data sets are difficult to make sense of (i.e: unstructured). The challenge is often to make sense of (structure) this data. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo opened a competition that I participated in for my final project in my Data 101 course. </p>

<p>The Competition</p>

<p>“Dialogues on social media can provide tremendous insight into the behaviors, desires, pains, and thoughts of consumers. We'd like your help in developing a repeatable process that identifies, classifies, and extracts the underlying drivers of consumer financial conversations and comments in social media data.”</p>

<p>Using just <a href="https://d18qs7yq39787j.cloudfront.net/uploads/contestfile/93/8af8575b213c-2015%2BWells%2BFargo%2BCampus%2BAnalytic%2BChallenge%2BDataset.txt">this document</a>, a team of 3 others and myself were tasked with answering two questions: </p>

<p>Question #1: What financial topics do consumers discuss on social media and what caused the consumers to post about this topic? </p>

<p>Question #2: Are the topics and “substance” consistent across the industry or are they isolated to individual banks? </p>

<p>With these two questions in mind, we had our work cut out for us.</p>

<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h1>

<p>Using the dataset, the first challenge – like in much of big data – was to structure or clean its contents. Un-cleaned, the social media posts looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8hdjJ2H.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see there are many of the same items that pop up post after post. Some of them being “twit_hndl”, “BankD”, “INTERNET”, “Name”, etc. </p>

<p>Using a sample size of 10,000 posts, we stripped out words or topics (such as “twit_hndl”, “INTERNET”) that we believed would not lend any importance to subsequent analysis. </p>

<p>In an effort to clean, the data frame of 10,000 posts must be made suitable for the text mining package and therefore it must be a Corpus(collection of text documents). Here is the code to convert Data Frame to Corpus and to clean Corpus of unnecessary meta data.</p>

<p>Following this code, the posts now look like the following</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dWYC0Wo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now that the data has been cleaned, analysis can follow.</p>

<p>To find out what topics consumers talked about on social media, we went ahead and found the most frequent terms using 10,000 posts.</p>

<p>The Corpus must first be turned into a Document-Term Matrix
'''R</p>

<p>dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(docs)
dtm = removeSparseTerms(dtm, 0.98) #removes words with very low frequency
findFreqTerms(dtm,100) #finds words that occur at least 100x
-&gt; '''</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
