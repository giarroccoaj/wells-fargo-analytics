<p>"Dialogues on social media can provide tremendous insight into the behaviors, desires, pains, and thoughts of consumers. We'd like your help in developing a repeatable process that identifies, classifies, and extracts the underlying drivers of consumer financial conversations and comments in social media data." - (<a href="https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/wells-fargo">https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/wells-fargo</a>)</p>

<p>Question #1: What financial topics* do consumers discuss on social media and what caused the consumers to post about this topic? </p>

<p>Deliverable A - Describe your Approach and Methodology. Include a visual representation of your analytic process flow. 
Deliverable B - Discuss the data and its relationship to social conversation drivers. 
Deliverable C - Document your code and reference the analytic process flow-diagram from deliverable A. </p>

<p>Question #2: Are the topics and “substance” consistent across the industry or are they isolated to individual banks? </p>

<p>Deliverable D - Create a list of topics and substance you found 
Deliverable E - Create a narrative of insights supported by the quantitative results (should include graphs or charts) </p>

<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h1>

<p>We used lists of positive and negative words and matched those words to text in the social media posts. A sentiment score for each post was calculated by the number of positive words minus the negative words. Very positive and very negative posts were defined as the score being &gt;= 2 or &lt;= 2 respectively. Then a data frame was made from 1000 posts sampled from the entire data frame. This data frame was further divided this into data frames for posts mentioning each bank respectively. Also, we made a data frame for posts containing "name". Finally, we ran the sentiment analysis on these subsets and calculated their scores and made graphs.
Additionally, from the sample database, we created five wordclouds, one for each bank and one for all four banks combined, demonstrating what conversations were taking in regards to the banks. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
